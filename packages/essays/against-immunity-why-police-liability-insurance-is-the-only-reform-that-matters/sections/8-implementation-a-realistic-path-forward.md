# Implementation: A Realistic Path Forward

## Key Points
- Federal framework: Argue for federal legislation requiring liability insurance as a condition of receiving DOJ grants (similar to how consent decrees work), establishing minimum coverage levels and prohibition on departments paying individual officer premiums
- State-level action: Highlight opportunities for states to follow Colorado's model with improvements—mandatory personal liability insurance, standardized misconduct databases tied to insurance underwriting, and removal of good-faith determination loopholes
- Transparency requirements: Connect insurance mandates to the Cost of Police Misconduct Act—require public reporting of premiums, claims, and coverage denials to create market pressure and informed public discourse
- Phase-in approach: Propose graduated implementation starting with high-cost departments, allowing insurance markets to develop risk models and pricing structures before universal rollout
