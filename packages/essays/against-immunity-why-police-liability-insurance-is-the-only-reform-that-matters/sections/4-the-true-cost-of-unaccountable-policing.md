# The True Cost of Unaccountable Policing

## Key Points
- Direct taxpayer burden: Break down the $300+ million annual cost, high-profile cases ($27M for George Floyd, $12M for Breonna Taylor, $45M for Randy Cox), and how these funds could alternatively support 1,200 teachers in NYC or 800 mental health professionals in Chicago
- The repeat offender problem: Spotlight the $1.5 billion spent on 7,600 officers with multiple misconduct claims—nearly half of all settlement costs—with examples like Detroit's officer with 10+ settlements costing $665,000+
- Hidden costs beyond settlements: Insurance premium increases (30%+ in some cities), bond interest and fees that nearly double actual settlement amounts, attorney fees, and opportunity costs of diverted municipal resources
- Social and economic externalities: Eroded public trust (documented declines in cooperation with police), property value declines in affected communities (Ferguson's $10M+ loss), and the cycle of tension and protest that further strains municipal budgets
