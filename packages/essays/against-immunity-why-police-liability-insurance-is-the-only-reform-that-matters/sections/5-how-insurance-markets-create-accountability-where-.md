# How Insurance Markets Create Accountability Where Politics Cannot

## Key Points
- The Colorado model: Examine SB 20-217 requiring officers to pay up to $25,000 (5% of judgments), the immediate response of insurance products emerging ($7-50/month), and early evidence of behavioral change
- Actuarial accountability: Explain how insurance underwriting creates automatic consequences—premiums increase with misconduct history, high-risk officers become uninsurable, departments must choose between firing problem officers or absorbing unsustainable premium costs
- Market efficiency vs. political gridlock: Insurance companies have no political allegiances, union obligations, or concern for optics—only mathematical risk assessment, making them immune to the pressures that have neutered every other reform attempt
- Precedent from other professions: Compare to medical malpractice insurance, which successfully identifies high-risk practitioners, drives behavior change through premium adjustments, and effectively removes the highest-risk individuals from practice when they become uninsurable
