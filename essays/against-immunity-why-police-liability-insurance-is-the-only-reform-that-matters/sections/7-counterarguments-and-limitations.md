# Counterarguments and Limitations

## Key Points
- The 'judgment-proof' officer problem: Address concerns that officers with modest salaries can't pay large settlements (that's why insurance is the solution—spreading risk while creating premium-based accountability)
- Will insurance just become another taxpayer burden?: Acknowledge the risk that departments will simply pay officer premiums from budgets, argue for regulations requiring personal premium responsibility with adjustments based on individual history
- The good-faith loophole: Examine how some Colorado municipalities (like Greenwood Village) declared they'll never find officers acted in 'bad faith,' argue this demonstrates why insurance must be mandatory and individually held rather than department-purchased
- Concerns about officer recruitment and retention: Address police union arguments that liability will drive officers away, counter with evidence that professionalization through accountability attracts higher-quality candidates (similar to how medical malpractice insurance didn't eliminate doctors)
