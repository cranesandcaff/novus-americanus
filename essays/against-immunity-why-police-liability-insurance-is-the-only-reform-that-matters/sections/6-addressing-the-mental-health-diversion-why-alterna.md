# Addressing the Mental Health Diversion: Why Alternative Response Isn't Enough

## Key Points
- The limits of unbundling: Acknowledge programs like Denver's STAR and Eugene's CAHOOTS show promise for mental health calls (3% of total calls, zero arrests in 750 Denver responses), but these address a small subset of police interactions and don't solve the accountability problem for the remaining 97% of police work
- The funding fallacy: Critique the 'defund to fund mental health' approach—mental health systems need independent funding (they've been underfunded since 1960s deinstitutionalization), and defunding police doesn't create accountability for remaining police functions
- Complementary, not alternative: Argue that mental health response teams AND liability insurance are both necessary—alternative response reduces inappropriate police contact, while insurance creates accountability for the police contact that remains necessary
- The warrior training problem: Connect how programs like Dave Grossman's 'Killology' training persist precisely because there are no financial consequences—insurance companies would immediately price out or refuse coverage for departments using fear-based training that increases liability risk
