# Introduction: The Hidden Tax of Police Misconduct

## Key Points
- Hook: Open with the staggering $3.2 billion cost to taxpayers over a decade from the 25 largest police departments, with specific examples like Chicago's $528 million and the irony that most citizens are unaware they're funding this
- Present the core problem: Despite massive costs, repeated misconduct, and decades of reform attempts (training, body cameras, community policing), nothing has fundamentally changed the incentive structure
- Thesis statement: Police liability insurance is the only reform that matters because it creates direct financial accountability through market mechanisms where all other reforms have failed—when officers and departments must carry insurance that adjusts based on misconduct history, the invisible hand of actuarial science accomplishes what political will cannot
- Brief roadmap: Outline the essay's progression from exposing why current reforms fail, to documenting the true costs of misconduct, to examining how insurance markets create accountability, to addressing counterarguments about alternative crisis response
