# The Illusion of Reform: Why Decades of Attempts Have Failed

## Key Points
- Catalog the reform graveyard: Implicit bias training, de-escalation training, body cameras, community policing, civilian oversight boards—all implemented widely with minimal impact on misconduct rates or costs
- The qualified immunity shield: Explain how current legal protections ensure officers face no personal financial consequences, with taxpayers covering 99.98% of settlement costs while officers rarely contribute anything
- The missing deterrent: Without personal financial stakes, officers who generate multiple lawsuits (the 1,200+ officers with five or more settlements, 200+ with ten or more) continue working with no meaningful consequences
- The data black hole: Cities don't track payments by officer name, use inconsistent definitions of misconduct, and lack standardized reporting—making it impossible to even identify problem officers or measure reform effectiveness
